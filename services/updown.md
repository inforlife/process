# [Updown](https://updown.io/)

Updown is an online service that checks website's status by periodically sending an HTTP HEAD request to its URL.

We currently monitor all our applications with a frequency of 10 minutes.

When an application cannot be reached, Updown notifies us on [Slack](https://inforlife.github.io/process/services/slack.html).
