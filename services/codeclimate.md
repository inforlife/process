# [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com)

We use Code Climate for quality metrics and code coverage.

## Quality Metrics

To setup quality metrics (static analysis), the following steps are executed.

  - We add the `.codeclimate.yml` file to the repository. This file defines  the tools used for the analysis.
  - In Code Climate, we add the project.
	- In Code Climate, the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://docs.codeclimate.com/v1.0/docs/github) integration is configured.

## Code Coverage *experimental*
