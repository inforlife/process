title:  "Issue Traceability"
---

Thanks to the branching strategy we adopt, we can trace each issue from gathering to release.

Each issue is implemented in a dedicated branch that is merged into the `master` branch through a GitHub Pull request. The reference to the Pull request is automatically added back to the GitHub Issue which describes the issue so for each issue, it is always possible to pinpoint the code that has implemented it.

Moreover, thanks to the use we do of GitHub Milestones and Releases, we can know in which release the code implementing a specific issue was included.
