title:  "Features Gathering"
---

The list of functionalities provided by an application are expressed as [**user stories**](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories) and managed through GitHub issues (and [zube.io](https://zube.io/) to visualize them in a Kanban style board). Keeping the functionalities directly on GitHub, it makes easy to link a user story to the branch that implements it and to ensure full [traceability](http://acsinfo.github.io/process/traceability.html) of the features in the source code. In this way, features' history is available to anyone who would like to audit it. 

Every collaborator of the project who wishes to require  new functionalities or report defects may create a new issue where he describes the feature he needs or the bug he has found.

Once a new issue is open by a collaborator, the development team reviews it in order to gather any missing information, to create a user story that complies with the defined standard.

GitHub issues are diveded into three categories.

 - [Features](http://acsinfo.github.io/process/features.html)
 - [Fixes](http://acsinfo.github.io/process/fixes.html)
 - [Payoffs](http://acsinfo.github.io/process/payoffs.html)

According to thier category a GitHub issue needs specific information to be considered complete and so ready to be implemented.

## Story sizing 

Like many other aspects of software product management, there isnâ€™t a universal right size for a user story. A user story may require from a couple of hours to a few days to be implemented. When defining user stories, the development team applies the following criteria.

 - A story should be small enough for the team to understand it.
 - A story should be small enough to be created in in a short time period.
 - A story should be big enough to represent business value in its own right. 
 - A story should be big enough to be deliverable in its own right.

In case a user story seems too big, it can be broken down into mutiple stories.
