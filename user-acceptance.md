title:  "User Acceptance"

During an iteration, the development team periodically (usually on a weekly basis) demonstrates all the issues already completed and not considered 'done' yet.

 At the demo participate all the owners of issues planned to be demonstrated (they are notified in advance by the development team).

Any other collaborator or user of the application is welcome to join the demo session.

After the demo, each issue owner accepts the issue or request further changes. To accept it, the owner simply adds the `Accepted` Label to the Issue. In case changes are required, the issue owner adds them as a comment to the Issue.

Accepted Issues are moved, by a member of the development team, to the 'Done' column in the `Development` Project and it is considered ready to be shipped. The Issue is also closed.

Issues that require changes are put back to the 'Backlog' column in the `Development` Project so the changes can be implemented following the standard [development process](https://inforlife.github.io/process/development.html).
